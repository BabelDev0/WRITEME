### Commits rules<a name="commits-rules"></a>

For commits it is recommended to use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org).

#### Type<a name="commit-type"></a>

The type must be one of the following:

-   feat: A new feature
-   fix: A bug fix
-   docs: Documentation only changes
-   style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
-   refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature (improvements of the code structure)
-   perf: A code change that improves the performance
-   test: Adding missing or correcting existing tests
-   build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, npm)
-   ci: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: travis, circle)
-   chore: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
-   revert: Reverts a previous commit

#### Scope<a name="commit-scope"></a>

The scope should be the name of the piece of the project affected.

#### Subject<a name="commit-subject"></a>

The subject contains a succinct description of the change:

-   Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
-   Don't capitalize the first letter
-   No dot (.) at the end
